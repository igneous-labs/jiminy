/// # Invariants
/// - At most one `Abr` exists for an entire jiminy program. This is guaranteed by
///   inaccessible private field and private constructors. The only way to safely obtain
///   this struct is via [`crate::DeserAccounts::etp_start`]
///   (unless the user chooses to do stupid things with `unsafe`).
///
/// With these invariants, we can now implement rust's XOR borrow rules at compile-time:
/// - `mut` borrow of an account mutable borrows the entire singleton `Abr`
/// - multiple immutable borrows of an account can immutably borrow the singleton `Abr`.
///
/// This invariant also allows us to remove lifetime annotations, since we can assume any
/// `AccountHandle` encountered in a jiminy program is valid
// do not derive Copy or Clone since this is supposed to be a program-wide singleton
